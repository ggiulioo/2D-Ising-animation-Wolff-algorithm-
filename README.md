# Ising_animation
This Julia code was developped during the course of Stochastic Simulation Methods in Physics held by Prof. Pagnani and Prof. Braunstein at Politecnico di Torino. It shows an animation of a 2D-Ising model, whose dynamics is described by Wolff rejectionless algorithm. 

To run the animation, save all the files in a folder, than open and run "main.jl"

Some changes are possible in terms of temperature (1/beta), termalisation steps, lattice size, initial configuration and external field.
